# BC06-02-Weather_Dashboard
A dashboard showing weather data for cities we can search for. These cities can be added to our list as buttons so that we have a one-push access to past detinations. 

## Description
Uses API calls to openweathermap.org for weather information by city.
We utilise the current conitions and a forecast from the API for the next 5 days to present the user with a comprehensive idea of hw the weather is at that location.
Locations can be saved, and the last location searched will be the first location presented when the screen is re-opened
